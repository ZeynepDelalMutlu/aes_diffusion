AVALANCHE EFFECT

In an encryption algorithm, changing even one bit in the key or plaintext causes a tremendous change on the ciphertext, called avalance effect. In this project, I worked on the avalanche effect of AES Encryption Algorithm.

In order not to predict anything about the original plainttext or key by looking at ciphertext, the avalance effect of the algorithm should be around %50. Thus, we can not put forward an idea about the original bits of the plaintext or key. In this project, I checked the avalanche effect of AES Encryption Algorithm. I changed one bit of both the original plaintext and then the original key as seperated experiments and observed rate of change of the cipher text. Both experiments shows us the avalanche effect of AES Encryption Algorithm is real.

This assginment is given as a lecture assignment in 'Mathematical Cryptography' class in TOBB University, Ankara/Turkey.

Only the main class is written by me. The other classes are provided by my lecturer.

Assignment questions and the answers are also provided in the project.

This is the sharing without profit making purpose.
